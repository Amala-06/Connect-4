# Connect-4
An age-old two-player game called Connect 4 is popular today. Players in the game take turns dropping coloured discs into a vertical grid with six rows and seven columns. In order to win, you must link four of your discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, and you must also stop your opponent from doing the same.
